Programming 3 Final Project
=============

By Miguel Chateloin

Change makefile's CC variable to the compiler of your preference if needed. Default is cc.

Executable created by make is *bot*. Run it with a non-zero positive number argument representing the number of pairs of input and output pipes.

e.g. 

`./bot 5`

Will produce 5 pipes to read from, and 5 pipes to read to.
